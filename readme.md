# A little Safety Tool for Poe

This tool takes the iteminfo of the item you are about to roll on and will check if you already hit your disired mod. If so it will kinda block your input by moving the mouse away and report with a lil beep.

Info about usage:

- You need to specify amounts of sections you want to skip (depth) because every Iteminfo has a different amount of sections. On the following Watchstone the Depth is [2] 

###### Watchstone Clipboard
>Rarity: Magic
Platinum Tirn's End Watchstone of the Prophet
-------- [Depth = 1]
Item Level: 85
-------- [Depth = 2]
Unique Bosses have 10.2% chance to drop an additional Silver Coin
-------- [Depth = 3]
Only the souls trapped within can bear witness to the Maven's dark proclivities, and they dare not speak up.
-------- [Depth = 4]
Socket this into a Citadel on your Atlas to increase the Tier of Maps and reveal hidden Maps in that Citadel's Region. You can only socket one Crimson, Viridian, Cobalt or Golden Watchstone into each Citadel.

- at this time the mod you're entering needs to be case-senstive!
- the mod needs to be a full description without numbers
- activate the checkbox after adding your mods to the list and wait for the beep
